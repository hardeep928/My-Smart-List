## 🧠 How It Works

* All tasks are stored in the browser's **localStorage**.
* When a task is created, it is saved instantly and persists even after reloading.
* You can edit or delete any task — the app updates your local data automatically.
* Each user sees their own tasks (if you later integrate Auth0 or user-based storage).
